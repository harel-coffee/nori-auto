# Non-linear genetics

Study of non-linear phenotype-genotype relationships in high-dimensional experiments, such as GWAS.

- [Data simulation](doc/data_generation.ipynb): brief analysis on how the data for benchmark are generated.
- [Benchmark on synthetic data](doc/benchmark.ipynb): analysis of synthetic data.
- [Required computational resources](doc/computational_resources.ipynb).

## Aplication to real world datasets

- [Images and microarrays](doc/benchmark_real.ipynb): prediction of 3 image datasets and 3 gene expression microarrays.
- [Single-cell RNA-seq](doc/single_cell.ipynb): prediction of cell phenotypes on three single-cell datasets.
- [GWAS](doc/gwas.ipynb): phenotype prediction and biomarker discovery on WTCCC1 datasets.
